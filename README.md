# Hey, I'm Adam (AKA. TenTyped)
Welcome to my GitHub! I'm a systems programmer who mainly works with C and C++,
though I occasionally dabble in Java, Python and Rust. I love building projects that interest me, especially when they're very bare and low level. You'll find most of my projects here, but I am planning to mainly move to GitLab.

## üå± What I'm working on
### Yarn üß∂
> **Heads up**: Yarn is still in its early days, nothing is public yet!

**Yarn** is my main focus right now. It's an OS/Kernel that I'm building from the ground up.
It's light weight, flexible, and powerful in it's purpose.
The goal? To emulate virtually anything I want ‚Äî New CPU Architecture? Yarn can probably emulate it. GPU? Emulatable. A PS4 emulator? Will actually be one of my first Yarn-based projects. If it's possible to emulate, Yarn should be able to handle it.

It's still very much a WIP, stay tuned.

### Starlight ‚≠ê
> **Currently on pause**: Starlight will be worked on once Yarn is developed and public, such that I can implement Starlight into Yarn.

Starlight is my take on a new graphics API. It's all about making rendering as fast as possible (whether it be practical or not). At the basic level, it's really a simple API, but that's merely because the basic functions are abstractions of the lower level functions which you can use on their own to truly hold the full potential. It's overall a simple system, but with tons of bare-metal features for those who like to get technical and deep.

### Other Stuff I tinker with üõ†Ô∏è
I‚Äôm always experimenting with new ideas. Some of the other things I‚Äôm working on or interested in include:

- Freestanding Architectures: Exploring architectures with no predefined ISA, allowing for customizable processing designs.
- Kernel Development: Diving deep into low-level systems programming and kernel optimization.
- Graphics and Game Engines: Looking at ways to improve performance and flexibility in rendering engines.

## üîß Tools and Interests
- Languages: C, C++, Rust, Java, Python
- Platforms: Arch Linux, Windows (basically always on Arch üíª)
- Interests: Emulation, Operating Systems, Hardware Architectures, AI

## Reach out
I‚Äôm always happy to chat about tech, projects, or even help out if you‚Äôre stuck with something. Feel free to reach out!
